# Adding a Real Screenshot to Documentation

To add a real screenshot of the KOBEDORK application to this documentation:

1. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to the main interface showing the dork builder
3. Take a screenshot of the interface (including the category selection, query builder, and template variants)
4. Save the image as "app-interface.png" in this docs/ directory
5. The README.md will automatically display your screenshot

The image should show:
- The left sidebar with dork categories
- The main query builder panel with target domain input
- The search engine selector (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- The template variants panel showing different dork options
- The dark/light theme toggle

This will provide users with a visual reference of what the application looks like.
